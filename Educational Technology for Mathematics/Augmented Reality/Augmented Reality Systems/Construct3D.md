# Augmented Reality and Mathematics

Construct3D is an [[Augmented Reality]] (AR) system that introduces the combination of 3D modelling of geometric shapes in an educational concept with the added feature of collaborative work [^1].  This system is overlayed on the system created by Szalavári et al. called “Studierstube” [^2].  In this system, learners’ model, manipulate, and visualize complex geometric shapes with a head-mounted display to see a virtual shape in their environment, shown in Figure 1, as well as a personal interaction panel to perform actions on the created objects [^1].  The personal interaction panel is augmented through the head-mounted display and learners can interact with it using a digital pen as seen in Figure 2.  The main userbase for this system is high school and [[University]] students due to the complex nature of the interactive panel [^1].  Similarly to a virtual reality system, the augmented reality system augments mathematical learning by increasing the ability for students to visualize mathematical concepts.
