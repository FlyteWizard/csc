## Learning Math with Augmented Reality (AR)

Augmented reality (AR) is the combination of the real-world environment mixed with manipulable virtual overlays [^1]. It has three essential features: having virtual elements overlaid over the real world, real-time interaction, and being registered in 3D. Often, people are not required to wear headsets like in [[Virtual Reality]], people usually only need a device with a screen and a camera such as a tablet or a smartphone.This independence from expensive equipment makes AR learning appealing in educational institutions. In learning, AR is used mostly to help students visualize complex models [^2]. In mathematical learning, AR is used to model and visualize complex graphs, shapes, and concepts otherwise described in a textbook drawing. The main benefit of using AR in a mathematical learning environment is that, while a textbook drawing may have the same information, students cannot explore the image further.  With AR, learners can dynamically manipulate and alter a geometric shape or graph to deepen their understanding of core math concepts.
