## Learning Math with Augmented Reality (AR)

Augmented reality (AR) is the combination of the real-world environment mixed with manipulable virtual overlays [^1]. It has three essential features: having virtual elements overlaid over the real world, real-time interaction, and being registered in 3D [^1]. Often, people are not required to wear headsets like in [[Virtual Reality]], people usually only need a device with a screen and a camera such as a tablet or a smartphone.  This independence from expensive equipment makes AR learning appealing in educational institutions. In learning, AR is used mostly to help students visualize complex models [^2]. In mathematical learning, AR is used to model and visualize complex graphs, shapes, and concepts otherwise described in a textbook drawing. The main benefit of using AR in a mathematical learning environment is that, while a textbook drawing may have the same information, students cannot explore the image further.  With AR, learners can dynamically manipulate and alter geometric shapes or graphs to deepen their understanding of core math concepts.
