# Tools For Creating Augmented Reality Applications

[[Augmented Reality]] focuses on providing a blended instructional strategy. The main focus is allowing users to explore and interact with previous 2D exclusive objects and concepts. It can be viewed as providing an object that can be manipulated without needed a wide range of physical objects. 

There are several tools used to create [[augmented reality]] applications. Tools like Unity 3D and Vuforia SDK are better in terms of usability to support the development process.
