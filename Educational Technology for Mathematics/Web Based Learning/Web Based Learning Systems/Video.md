## Self-Paced E-Learning with Video

Educational videos are often used as supplement material to explain complex concepts. Some [[university]] professors create entire lecture videos or use a flipped classroom approach and deliver short videos of content and then do problem-solving examples in lecture.

YouTube, a video hosting website, is a popular method of distribution for educators. Neso Academy [^1], for example, has a mission of providing free and subsidized education. "Introduction to Discrete Mathematics" [^2] a video motivating students to learn discrete math has over 700k views with a positive ratio in feedback. usually the purpose of these is to encourage self-directed learning by providing easy access to course material.

Educational videos are often made with a tablet and a computer program to write on a digital whiteboard. They can be digitally similar to [[interactive whiteboards]] but without learner touch interaction. [[KhanAcademy]] [^3] is another example of a successful YouTube channel that promotes learning and curiosity. A few other notable channels are: Numberphile [^4], Mathademics [^5], and Dr. Trefor Bazett [^6]. These channels often use problem-based approaches to teach complex concepts.

According to Dr. Trefor Bazett [^8] videos should be no more than 3 minutes long. However, it is not uncommon to have 20 minute videos in higher levelled mathematics. Bazett also mentions that the benefits of videos are lowered extrinsic load and boosted germane load for learners.
