# Self-Paced E-Learning with Video

Educational videos are often used as supplement material to explain complex concepts. Some University Professors create entire lecture videos or use a flipped classroom approach and deliver short videos of content and then do problem-solving examples in lecture.

[[YouTube]] is a popular method of distribution. Neso Academy [^1], for example, has a mission of providing free and subsidized education. "Introduction to Discrete Mathematics" [^2] a video motivating students to learn discrete math has over 700k views with a positive ratio for feedback.

Educational videos often use a tablet with a computer program to write on a digital whiteboard. They can digitally be similar to [[Interactive Whiteboards]] but without the touch interaction. [[KhanAcademy]] [^3] is another example of a successful YouTube channel that promotes learning. A few other channels are: Numberphile [^4], MathademicsÂ [^5], and Dr. Trefor Bazett [^6]. These channels often use problem-based approaches to teach concepts.

"Problem-based video podcasts provide short, web-based, audio-visual explanations of how to solve specific procedural problems in subject areas such as mathematics" [^7]. According to Dr. Trefor Bazett [^8] videos should be no more than 3 minutes long. However, it is not uncommon to have 20 minute videos.

The benefits of videos are lowered extrinsic load and boosted germane load.
