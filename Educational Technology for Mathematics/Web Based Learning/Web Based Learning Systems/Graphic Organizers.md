## Augmenting Mathematical Learning with Graphic Organizers (GO)

Graphics Organizers are descriptive images used to help students understand important content within a given topic [^1].  The development of these GO's have been particularly helpful for students with learning disabilities [^1]. To be precise, GO's are methods of displaying how information is connected in a visual fashion, such as a Venn Diagram as seen in Figure 1 [^1].  Another example of a GO is a directed graph that has individual concepts attributed to a node and edges between each node illustrating their relation to each other [^1].

In mathematical learning, GO's have been helpful for students with disabilities to understand where key information in textbooks are, which is difficult for many students in this demographic [^1].  It provides a visual and guided representation of mathematical knowledge that they should obtain from their lessons.  These benefits have been seen in [[Elementary School]] up to [[High School]] [^1].  Additionally, one activity in particular that assisted students was to finish a partially complete GO diagram, which helped ensure students and teachers that no one is lost [^1].
