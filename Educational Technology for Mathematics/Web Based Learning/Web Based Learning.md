## Web Based Learning (Web Application)

Web-based learning refers to the type of accessible learning that educational institutions utilize to augment learning on a desktop computer[^1].  This type of learning manifests in the form of web applications.  These applications include calculators, graphing and modelling software, and education programs.  Students from a variety of age groups, from [[elementary school]] to [[university]], utilize these tools in order to make their education more robust.  First, like [[Virtual Reality]] and [[Augmented Reality]] tools, web-based applications can be used to help learners visualize data and geometry.  Other typical assistance appears in the form of calculators.  These digital calculators often provide many functions that are not available on one single physical calculator and provide detailed instructions on how to complete activities.  These web-based applications are surely augmenting mathematical learning because they provide students with tools to learn and absorb complex mathematical concepts.  Additionally, because most institutions have computers for students to use, these are very accessible programs for students to use.
