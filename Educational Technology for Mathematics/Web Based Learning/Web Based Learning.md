## Web Based Learning (Web Application)

Web-based learning refers to the type of accessible learning that educational institutions utilize to augment learning on a desktop computer [^1]. This type of learning manifests in the form of web applications and websites. These applications include calculators, graphing and modelling software, and educational programs. Students from all age groups, from [[elementary school]] to [[university]], utilize these tools in order to make their education more robust. Like [[Virtual Reality]] and [[Augmented Reality]] tools, web-based applications can be used to help learners visualize data and geometry. Other typical assistance appears in the form of digital calculators. These digital calculators often provide functions that are not currently available on one single physical calculator and they provide more detailed instructions on how to complete problems. These web-based applications are surely augmenting mathematical learning because they provide students with tools to learn and absorb complex mathematical concepts. Additionally, because most institutions have computer labs for students, these are largely by default accessible programs for students.
