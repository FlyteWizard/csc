## Mathway.com to Support Mathematical Learning

[[Web Based Learning]] gives access to millions of users at the same time. Mathway.com is a prominent platform for learning math. They offer a web-based application and a mobile-based application ([[Mathway]]).

Similar to the mobile version, Mathway.com contains detailed explanations for a variety of topics such as trigonometry, linear algebra, and calculus. These resources provide real-time help with mathematical problems so that students may understand concepts without the aid of a textbook or educator.

Figure 1 displays an empty input screen for the algebra-based equation solver [^1]. Within the same figure, Figure 1, a menu can be seen that shows each type of equation solver that is supported [^1]. Like [[Wolfram Alpha]], Mathway provides detailed explanations for solutions. This is a supportive feature in mathematics for two reasons: first, it provides students with personalized support and, second, it provides an additional resource to understaffed teaching teams.
