## Mathway to Support Mathematical Learning

Mathway, founded in 2002 by middle school friends Frank Balcavage and Jake Kuehner, is a leading, [[Web Based Learning]] math solver platform, which has been purpose-built to eventually become the first fully-automated online math tutor [^1].  Figure 1 displays the input screen for the algebra-based equation solver [^1].  Within the same figure, a menu can be seen that shows each type of equation solver that this system supports [^1].  Like most equation solvers, Mathway provides detailed explanations for equations that students are working on.  This is a supportive feature in mathematics for two reasons.  First, it provides students with personalized support and, second, it provides a resource to understaffed teaching teams.
