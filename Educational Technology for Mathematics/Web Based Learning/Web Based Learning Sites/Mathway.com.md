## Mathway.com to Support Mathematical Learning

[[Web Based Learning]] gives access to million users at the same time. Mathway.com is a prominent platform for learning math in both web form and mobile form, [[Mathway]].

Similar to the mobile version, Mathway.com contains detailed explanations for a variety of topics as seen in Figure 1.  These resources provide real-time help with mathematical problems so that students may understand concepts without the aid of a textbook.

Figure 1 displays the input screen for the algebra-based equation solver [^1].  Within the same figure, a menu can be seen that shows each type of equation solver that this system supports [^1].  Like most equation solvers, Mathway provides detailed explanations for equations that students are working on.  This is a supportive feature in mathematics for two reasons.  First, it provides students with personalized support and, second, it provides a resource to understaffed teaching teams.
