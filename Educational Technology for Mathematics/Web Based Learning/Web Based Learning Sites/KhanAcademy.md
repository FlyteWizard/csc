## Khan Academy to Support Mathematics Learning

KhanAcademy is a [[Web Based Learning]] designed to enhance mathematical education in schools.  This website offers activities that students can practice within an educational setting and at their own pace outside of school [^1].  KhanAcademy is atypical as it provides students with a unique dashboard that tracks their progress as they move through learning modules [^1].  Often, these modules coincide with the typical North American math curriculum.  This system is a useful tool for both educators and students as it guides them through concepts in tandem with their instructors.  Mathematical topics include concepts from pre-kindergarden, [[Elementary School]], [[High School]], and [[University]].  Figure 1 shows a landing page for a high school geometry course.
