Wolfram Alpha is an application most known for mathematics but also has tools for sciences, tech, society, culture, and everyday life. It allows users to access step-by-step solutions to mathematical problems and can provide visuals to core concepts. For example, it can provide graphs alongside equations. The concept of the application can viewed as a self-paced learning tool for students [[learning]] math.

In Figure 1 Wolfram Alpha provides a step-by-step solution for the integration of $\int x^2 \sin^3(x) dx$. As well, it also plots the integral providing a visual representation of the final equation.

Step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems returns the learning initiative to students. Allowing them to access solutions reduces the dependence on educators and provides timely help.
