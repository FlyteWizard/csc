Wolfram Alpha is an application most known for mathematics but also has tools for sciences, tech, society, culture, and everyday life. It allows users to access step-by-step solutions to mathematical problems and can provide visuals to core concepts.  It can viewed as a self-paced learning tool for students learning math.

In Figure 1 Wolfram Alpha is providing a step-by-step solution to the integration of $\int x^2 \sin^3(x) dx$. It also plots the integral as to provide a visual representation of the equation.
