# Desmos Studio and Graphing Calculator

We believe that everyone has an inner mathematician and that some people haven’t been given the opportunity, encouragement, or tools to discover theirs. So we prioritize [equity](https://www.desmos.com/equity?lang=en) and [accessibility](https://www.desmos.com/accessibility?lang=en) at every level of our work" [^1].

Desmos is a [[Web Based Learning]] system that provides a variety of services including a Graphing Calculator, Matrix Calculator, and Geometry Tool. They also have a [[Mobile-Based Learning]] application. 

In Figure 1 Desmos is performing a matrix multiplication. The user inputs the required matrices and then Desmos performs the calculations. For example...

$$
A = \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
		1 & 0 \\
		0 & 1 \\
	\end{array} } \right]
, \: \: 
B = \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
		0 & 1 \\
		1 & 0 \\
	\end{array} } \right]
$$
And...

$$
A \times B = \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
				0 & 1 \\
				1 & 0 \\
			\end{array} } \right].
$$

However, unlike [[Wolfram Alpha]], it does not provide a step-by-step solution. Thus, students can use the tool to check their calculations, but they cannot use it as a self-paced learning tool.
