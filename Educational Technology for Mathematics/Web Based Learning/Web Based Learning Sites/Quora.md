> > 2.  Work through problems yourself. There is no use is just reading about maths. You really have to solve problems to get anything out of it.
> > 3.  Get a good teacher. Maybe this means finding a tutor. Maybe it means spending time with a friend who knows her maths.
> > 4.  Don’t get discouraged. Maths is hard for everyone, and takes years to learn. In fact, you can never finish learning it. Don’t beat yourself up if you find something difficult to understand.
> > 5.  Work with other people. Working with friends makes the whole experience way more fun. This shouldn’t be a slog. Maths can be intensely social."
