# Learning Math with Audio and Braille Systems

Audio and Braille learning refers to systems like Nemeth Code, math2braille, and [[REMathEx]]. These learning system are largely used by people with little to no vision in math focused contexts. Similar to LaTeX [^1], REMathEx enhances rendering of mathematical equations.

The audio and braille systems complement the already established methods such as Arithmetic and Algebra Frame, Taylor Frame, and [[Ancient Analog Calculator|Abacus]].

Audio systems can also help students learn names and numbers with reinforcement learning. For example, counting numbers as they appear on a screen.
