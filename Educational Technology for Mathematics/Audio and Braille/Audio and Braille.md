## Learning Math with Audio and Braille Systems

Audio and Braille learning refers to systems like [[Nemeth Code]], [[math2braille]], and [[REMathEx]]. These learning system are largely used by people with little to no vision in math focused contexts. Similar to LaTeX [^1], REMathEx enhances rendering of mathematical equations.

The audio and braille systems complement the already established methods such as the Arithmetic and Algebra Frame, the Taylor Frame, and the [[Ancient Analog Calculator|Abacus]].

The Taylor Frame was developed by William Taylor in the mid 19th century [^2]. Figure 1 shows a modern version of the Taylor Frame sold by Prime Braille.

Audio systems can also help students learn numbers with the reinforcement learning method. For example, counting numbers as they appear on a screen.
