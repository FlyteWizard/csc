## Reader and Editor of the Mathematical Expressions

"\[REMathEx\] uses the combination of the braille display and the speech synthesis outputs to provide the user with all the information concerning studied mathematical expressions" [^1]. The system uses the MathML format to store the mathematical expressions and is designed as an object oriented system. It uses the Audis hypertext system.

Figure 1 shows a simplified structure of the REMathEx system. It begins by reading tables, transforming them into a Dokument Structure with resulting math expressions. Finally it is transferred to an application that uses text-to-speech.

The system still needs better navigation and faster orientation inside the mathematical expression. And it still needs a system for modifying mathematical expressions.
