math2braille is a module that will soon be an open source system to provide an accessible solution for mathematical equation representation. This system is similar to [[REMathEx]], MathML, and LaTeX. The Module converts MathML to Braille [^1]. Figure 1 shows an example of MathML code being translate to a visual representation of Braille.
