# Learning Math with Mobile-Based Learning

Mobile-based learning refers to applications and software that is used on a mobile device like a smartphone or tablet.  This learning, like [[Web Based Learning]], is particularly appealing for educational institutions because of its ease of use and accessibility.  For mathematics, mobile-based learning is used for completing homework and tracking progress as well as providing students with exercises outside of a textbook environment.  Additional features of mathematical mobile-based learning softwares is the amount of tools they offer.  Mobile calculators and graph interfaces allow students to focus on learning the concepts, anywhere and at anytime [^1].  However, it should be noted that even though smartphones are ubiquitous in todays society, not every student may have access to one at all times.  Furthermore, like a lot of systems targeting young learners, these mobile-based applications often utilize [[Game-Based Learning]].  For younger-aged students, games are used to increase engagement and enjoyment with mathematical concepts as seen in [[Albert]].  In contrast, for older students, applications are more professional and are mostly utilized for progress and activity completion tracking.
