## Accessible Mathematics with Albert

Albert is a [[Mobile-Based Learning]] application that creates a fun and engaging environment for children ages 3 to 9 as well as teenagers from ages 10 to 16 to practice various mathematical problems whenever is most convenient [^1, 2].  Just like in [[Game-Based Learning]], the program for the younger children (the lower grades of [[Elementary School]]) is dedicated to making math as engaging as possible to increase engagement and the intrinsic motivation to pursue mathematics (video link: [https://vimeo.com/565492893](https://vimeo.com/565492893)) [^1].  For older learners, like in [[High School]], the curriculum of the application has been synchronized with the British education system so that learners can complete activities and learn mathematics at their own pace [^2].  Completing the exercises at their own pace also creates an environment in which students are motivated to learn more [^3].  This system augments learning math by gamifying the concepts and increasing motivation to complete otherwise mentally exhaustive tasks.
