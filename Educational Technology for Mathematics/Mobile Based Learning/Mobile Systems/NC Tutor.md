## Learning Nemeth Code with NC Tutor Mobile Application

[[Nemeth Code]] is a language for writing mathematics in braille. The purpose of nemeth code is to shorten the length of mathematical equations compared to Unified English Braille (UEB).

TC Tutor Mobile Application attempts to help students learn both nemeth code and math. Nemeth code has a lot of rules and is essentially another language to learn on top of learning mathematics [^1].

The application takes input from a touch screen and then outputs voiced and vibrational feedback. Figure 1 shows the initial design of the application. Users have the option to learn math braille, complete exercises, and access a calculator.

The hope of the completed application is to complement the [[Audio and Braille|Taylor Frame]], and the [[Ancient Analog Calculator|Abacus]] in classrooms.
