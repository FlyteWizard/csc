## Learning Nemeth Code with NC Tutor Mobile Application

[[Nemeth Code]] is a language for writing mathematics in braille. The purpose of nemeth code is to shorten the length of mathematical equations compared to Unified English Braille (UEB).

The NC Tutor Mobile Application attempts to help students learn both nemeth code and math at the same time. Nemeth code has a lot of rules and is essentially another language to learn on top of [[learning]] mathematical notation [^1].

The application takes input from a touch screen and then outputs voiced and vibrational feedback. Figure 1 shows the initial design of the application. Users have the option to learn math braille, complete exercises, and/or access a calculator.

The hope of the completed application is to complement the [[Audio and Braille|Taylor Frame]], and the [[Ancient Analog Calculator|Abacus]] in classrooms for students in [[Elementary School]], [[High School]], and [[University]].
