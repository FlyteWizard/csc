## Arithmetic Calculations with a Digital Abacus

Ancient Analog Calculator is a mobile Japanese Abacus simulator. An Abacus is generally used to teach Japanese [[Elementary School]] students how to do basic arithmetic in mathematics [^1]. Figure 1 shows the Japanese Abacus simulator. The application allows students to touch the beads to move them into the correct position during calculations. The advantage of a [[Mobile-Based Learning]] application is the addition of visual support. Below the abacus simulator there is room to display numbers to aid students by providing instance numerical feedback.

Similarly to [[Albert]], the purpose of creating a digital application is for ease of [[learning]]. Students can use the Japanese Abacus simulator at anytime and they do not need to rely on having access to the physical device.

The system augments math learning by enhancing mental calculations and improving speed [^2]. Students can become efficient in performing basic arithmetic. It also lowers the mental load by using the [[Mobile-Based Learning]] system.
