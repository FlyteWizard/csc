## Mathway to Assist Mathematic Learning

Mathway is a [[Mobile-Based Learning]] platform for students with the tools they need to understand and solve their math problems. They also have a [[Web Based Learning]] platform called [[Mathway.com]].

Mathway, founded in 2002 by middle school friends Frank Balcavage and Jake Kuehner, is a leading, online math solver platform, which has been purpose-built to eventually become the first fully-automated online math tutor [^1,2].
