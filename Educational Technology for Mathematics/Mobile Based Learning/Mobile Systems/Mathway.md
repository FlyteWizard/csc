## Mathway to Assist Mathematic Learning

Mathway is a [[Mobile-Based Learning]] application for students that allows learners to get direct help with a math equation on demand [^1].  Mathway also has a [[Web Based Learning]] counterpart called [[Mathway.com]].  In order to utilize the functions of this system, students take a picture of their current math problem with their mobile phone and submit it to receive instant solutions and explanations [^1].

The Mathway app provides students with the necessary resources for both comprehending and resolving mathematical problems. Students from a diverse demographics can be able to obtain high-quality on-demand arithmetic help, according to their long-term objectives because Mathway is composed of ten calculators [^1].  These available calculators include solutions for statistics, algebra, trigonometry, calculus, and fundamental math [^1].  There are also additional resources for solving chemistry equations [^1].  Accessibility is greatly encouraged by mobile calculators like Mathway, since students can now have a mobile textbook available when they need it.
