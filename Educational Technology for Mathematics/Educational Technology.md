Technology is booming in every industry, from business to communication to education and lifestyle. [[Learning]] have expanded and reached to more people with [[Educational Technology]] or EdTech. In recent times [[Artificial Intelligence]] is helping students solving complex problem using mobile devices. With the help of [[Audio and Braille]] people with special need is learning basic to complex mathematics and contributing in human kind. [[Augmented Reality]] has opens door to new learning possibilities, where student learn from real-world environment mixed with manipulable virtual overlays. [[Mixed Reality]] keeps the user physically interacting with the digital application of the system.

[[Mobile-Based Learning]] become accessible even in the period of COVID-19, students in developed country to developing country, every where they used distance learning method to teach students. With the help of mobile based systems like [[Mathway]] where students take a picture of their current math problem with their mobile phone and submit it to receive instant solutions and explanations.

[[Web Based Learning]] is not new, its started since the starting of WWW. In [[KhanAcademy]] student can practice within an educational setting and at their own pace outside of school. There are a bunch of good web sites like [[Mathway.com]], [[Quora]] math, [[Wolfram Alpha]] and many more  available for learning math.

Therefore it's absolute that [[Educational Technology]] is helping the humanity to spade the knowledge more and in a broad way.
