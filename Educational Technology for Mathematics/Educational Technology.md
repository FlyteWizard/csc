## Educational Technology and Mathematics

> [!quote]

Technology is booming in every industry, from business to communication to education and lifestyle. The psychology of [[Learning]] has been able to expand and reach more people with the use of [[Educational Technology]] or EdTech. In recent times [[Artificial Intelligence]] is helping students by solving complex problems using mobile devices. With the help of [[Audio and Braille]], people with visual disabilities are able to learn basic to complex mathematics in a similar fashion to their able-bodied counterparts. [[Augmented Reality]] has created opportunities for new learning possibilities, where students can learn from real-world environments mixed with manipulable virtual overlays. [[Mixed Reality]] helps to keep users engaged by allowing them to physically interact with the digital components of the given system.

[[Mobile-Based Learning]] is an accessible tool, especially in the period of COVID-19.  Learners across the globe can use mobile tools as a method to educate.  With the help of mobile based systems like [[Mathway]] and [[Albert]], students can access mathematics anywhere at the convenience of their mobile phone.  Additionally, mobile systems create the opportunity for large communities that can also aid in mathematical learning.

Similarly, [[Web Based Learning]] can be utilized to progress mathematical learning.  Since this technology is not as modern as many, there are many established website like [[KhanAcademy]], [[Mathway]], [[Quora]], and [[Wolfram Alpha]] that can help learners understand tricky concepts more efficiently.  These systems also provide the added benefit of being at the students own pace.  

With all of this information in mind, it is clear that educational Technology is helping society improve mathematical learning from many angles.
