## Educational Technology and Mathematics

> [!quote]

Technology is booming in every industry, from business to communication to education and lifestyle. The psychology of [[learning]] has been able to expand and reach more people with the use of [[Educational Technology]] or EdTech. In recent times [[Artificial Intelligence]] is helping students by solving complex problems using mobile devices. With the help of [[Audio and Braille]], people with visual disabilities are able to learn basic to complex mathematics in a similar fashion to their able-bodied counterparts. [[Augmented Reality]] has created opportunities for new learning possibilities, where students can learn from real-world environments mixed with manipulable virtual overlays. [[Mixed Reality]] helps to keep users engaged by allowing them to physically interact with the digital components of the given system.

[[Mobile-Based Learning]] is an accessible tool, especially in the period of COVID-19. Learners across the globe can use mobile tools as a method to educate. With the help of mobile based systems like [[Mathway]] and [[Albert]], students can access mathematics anywhere at the convenience of their mobile phone. Additionally, mobile systems create the opportunity for large communities that can also aid in mathematical learning.

Similarly, [[Web Based Learning]] can be utilized to progress mathematical learning. There are many established website like [[KhanAcademy]], [[Mathway]], [[Quora]], and [[Wolfram Alpha]] that can help learners understand tricky concepts more efficiently. These systems also provide the added benefit of being self-paced.  

Finally, with all of this information in mind, it is clear that educational technology is helping society improve mathematical learning from many angles.
