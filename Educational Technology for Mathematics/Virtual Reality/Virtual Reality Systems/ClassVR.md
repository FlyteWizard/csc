## Visualization in ClassVR

ClassVR is a [[Virtual Reality]] (VR) system that may work alone or in a duo with the ARCube created by the same organization [^1]. With this system, shown in Figure 1, students enter an immersive environment where they can complete arithmetic and geometric tasks such as counting, estimating numbers, and learning about fractals as well as creating and manipulating 3D shapes and models [^1]. Students are also able to look in-depth at shapes within images as well as deconstruct them to further their experience. For example, students in one lesson were shown an image from a celebration of light in China [^2]. Students were able to zoom into individual lanterns and deconstruct their shape to further explore the geometric models involved in practical situations [^2]. This system is designed for a classroom setting, especially in [[Elementary School]] aged children to students in their teens ([[High School]]).  With the inclusion of images, there is also an opportunity for cultural learning as well [^2].
