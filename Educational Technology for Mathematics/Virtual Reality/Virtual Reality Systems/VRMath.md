# Visualizing Mathematics using VRMath

VRMath is a software system that allows learners to create and manipulate 3D geometric shapes as well as visualize graphs, fractals, and other mathematical concepts like complex object design [1].  This system was designed to create an affordable technology that enables learners to re-organize their ideas and visualize mathematical concepts that would otherwise be unavailable to them [1].  This system exists as a desktop application as well as a [[Virtual Reality]] (VR) application.  When a learner opens the web application, they can trigger the VR extension by scanning a QR code.  The target demographic of this system is wide, from elementary aged students learning about shapes, to university students learning about precise design.  The geometric modelling interface is shown in Figure 1.
