## Visualizing Mathematics using VRMath

VRMath is a software system that allows learners to create and manipulate 3D geometric shapes as well as visualize graphs, fractals, and other mathematical concepts like complex object design [^1].  This system was designed to create an affordable technology that enables learners to re-organize their ideas and visualize mathematical concepts that would otherwise be unavailable to them [^1].  This system exists as a desktop application as well as a [[Virtual Reality]] (VR) application.  When a learner opens the web application, they can trigger the VR extension by scanning a QR code.  The target demographic of this system is wide, from [[Elementary School]] aged students learning about shapes, to [[University]] students learning about precise design.  The geometric modelling interface is shown in Figure 1.
