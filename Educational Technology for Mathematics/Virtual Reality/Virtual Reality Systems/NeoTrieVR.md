# Using NeoTrieVR to Manipulate 3D Shapes

NeoTrieVR is a system that enables learners to dynamically model and manipulate 3D shapes in a [[Virtual Reality]] (VR) environment [^1].  Not only can learners use software tools to create and model 3D shapes, but they can also immerse themselves in a design experience as if in a real-life design project [^1].  Learners can simulate real-world tools and learn their uses in a safe, efficient, and engaging display of geometry and modelling (video: [https://youtu.be/ulIAt0hr7s8](https://youtu.be/ulIAt0hr7s8)) [^1].  Like most VR learning augmentation systems, NeoTrieVR is most productive in assisting learners visualize complex geometric shapes.  Learners for this system range from children to university students.
