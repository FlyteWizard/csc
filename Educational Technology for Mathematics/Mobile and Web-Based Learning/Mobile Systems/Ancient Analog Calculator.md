# Arithmetic Calculations with a Digital Abacus

Ancient Analog Calculator is a mobile Japanese Abacus simulator. An Abacus is generally used to teach Japanese primary school students how to do basic arithmetic in mathematics [^1]. Figure 1 shows the Japanese Abacus simulator. The application allows students to touch the beads to move them into the correct position during calculations. The advantage of a mobile application is the addition of visual support. Below the abacus simulator there is room to display numbers to aid students by providing instance numerical feedback.

Similarly to [[Albert]], the purpose of creating a digital application is for ease of [[learning]]. Students can use the Japanese Abacus simulator at anytime and they do not need to rely on having access to the physical device.

The system augments math [[learning]] by enhancing mental calculations and improving speed [^2]. Students can become efficient in performing basic arithmetic and lowering mental load.
