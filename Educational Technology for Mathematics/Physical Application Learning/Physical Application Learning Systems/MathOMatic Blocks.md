## Theoretical Education System to Help Blind Students Learn Math

Many of the systems within this vault require vision to be able to utilize the digital tools.  [[Virtual Reality]], [[Mixed Reality]], and [[Augmented Reality]] are all digital overlays within the visual world.  The theoretical system proposed by A. Karshmer aims to remedy that for [[Elementary School]] education.  This [[Physical Application Learning]] system, titled MathOMatic Blocks, is simple.  It is an automated educational system of braille-based math blocks [^1].  The way the system works is a touch sensitive device is utilized to display a math problem to the student and then track the students progress efficiently [^1].  A student will be given an exercise in braille on the display and they will complete the activity with the given braille-blocks placed in a specific order on top of the display [^1].  This automated process is depicted in Figure 1.  In Figure 2, an example of the student receiving the wrong answer for an exercise.  They will receive verbal feedback in order to learn the concept and where their error was[^1].
