## Interactive Whiteboards for Teaching Mathematics

An Interactive Whiteboard (IBW) is an electronic whiteboard that provides a digital interface via a projector to display computer images [^1]. It functions as a traditional chalkboard that supports interactive flipcharts, dry-wipe writing, and video integration [^2]. The brand name SMART Boards$^{\text{TM}}$ [^3] instead uses an interactive display with SMART Pens. 

Although IBWs were largely adopted in the early 2000's most of them have now been replaced with personal tablets [^1]. However, there are mobile applications that supplement IBWs [^4] with Portable Interactive Whiteboards (PIWBs). The PIWBs allows students to interact with course material through the "Explain Everything" methodology by recording lessons and uploading screencasts. 

The ability to capture students thought process with (P)IBWs lets them deeply engage with the course material [^4]. When applied to mathematics, students became more motivated in problem-solving. In addition, instructors could review screencasts to identify students strong and weak points when solving problems and provide tailored feedback to each student.

As well, (P)IWBs can quickly adapt to students interests. In a study on reasoning about young children's mathematical education with IWBs [^5], an instructor mentioned that students could customize the counting objects. Increasing young children's involvement in mathematical learning.

In Figure 1 a student is using an IWB to correctly match by dragging and dropping elements.

In the study, it is mentioned that [[Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge|TPACK]] is an important part of learning to teach using technology. Instructors having a solid grasp on the fundamentals of their subject enhances the learning process for students (an important part of adopting new systems).
