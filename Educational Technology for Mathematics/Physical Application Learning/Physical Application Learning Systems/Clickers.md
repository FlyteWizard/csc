## Using Clickers for Formative Assessment in Classrooms

A clicker is a physical or mobile application that records answers to multiple choice questions. In some cases more complex assessments can be created for learners. The iClicker [^1] is a well known system at [[University]]. Platforms such as Zoom [^2] also have digital versions of clickers that allow educators to quiz students during lecture.

The purpose of clickers during lectures is to encourage student participation with active learning. According to iClicker utilizing polls, and quizzes increases end-of-course grades [^1].

Clickers can allow educators to notice areas of confusion before formal examinations. In a study by D. Polly, E. Rodgers, and M. Little they stated that "student's demonstrated their mathematical understanding in numerous ways besides keying their answer choice into the clickers" [^3]. Using these numerous ways educators can then identify areas of confusion and ask students to clarify their thought process that lead them to the incorrect answers and then correct the errors.

Educators that wish to incorporate clickers into math courses will most likely need to follow [[Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge|TPACK]] to gain the full benefits [^4]. The continuous feedback allows for question iteration to account for time constraints when needed.
