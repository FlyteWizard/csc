## Gesture-based Physical Learning

In this study by Thakkar et al. [^1], [[learning]] mathematics is augmented using gesture recognition. The goal is to use 3D animation software to create an interactive and [[Game-Based Learning]] environment to enhance mathematics learning. The 3D animation software is designed to be engaging for [[Elementary School]] students (~ages 6 -12) and is created using the software Blender. The gesture software is developed using a Microsoft Kinect tool and the open-source software Flexible Action and Articulated Skeleton Toolkit (FAAST). Learners use physical movements and gestures as an input for the game, MathMazing, shown in Figure 1. Leaners play through randomly generated arithmetic questions that are appropriate to their education level. When learners correctly answer a question, they progress through the level and if they incorrectly answer a question, their progress is paused by their player avatar being hindered by an obstacle. For example, their avatar might fall into water next to their desired path. A typical level is shown in Figure 1, with a path and the accompanying water next to it.

Figure 2 depicts the flow of the learning system. It begins with input gestures by the players that are then capture by the Kinect device. Software is then used to display the end result as shown in Figure 1.
