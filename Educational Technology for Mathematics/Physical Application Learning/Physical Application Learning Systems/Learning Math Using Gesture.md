Learning Math Using Gesture

In this study by Thakkar et al. [^1], learning mathematics is augmented using gesture recognition.  The goal is to use 3D animation software to create an interactive and [[Game-Based Learning]] environment to enhance mathematics learning.  The 3D animation software is designed to be engaging for primary school students (~ages 6 -12) and is created using Blender.  The gesture software is developed using a Microsoft Kinect tool and the open-source software Flexible Action and Articulated Skeleton Toolkit (FAAST).  Learners use physical movements and gestures as an input for the game, MathMazing, shown in Figure 1 and play through randomly generated arithmetic questions that are appropriate to their education level.  When learners correctly answer a question, they progress through the level and if they incorrectly answer a question, their progress is paused by their player being hindered by an obstacle like falling into water next to their path.  A typical level is shown in Figure 1, with a path and the accompanying water next to it.  Figure 2 depicts the flow of this learning system.
