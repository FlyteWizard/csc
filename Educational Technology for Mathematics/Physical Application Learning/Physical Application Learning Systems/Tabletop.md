## Tabletop System to Promote Learning

"The study provides evidence to suggest several reasons why the tabletop instructional effectiveness is higher than that using traditional construction tools with \[students\]" [^2]. In the study they explore a touch based system for interacting with money through a Virtual Shopping Simulation Game for Currency. The [[game-based learning]] approach allowed students to work collaboratively to solve problems and engage in role play scenarios. Students were encouraged to work together to solve problems. For example, the third activity focused on selecting the correct currency amount for purchasing at a store.

Figure 1 shows a tabletop system composed of a video projector, two cameras with stereoscopic views, and an interactive area. As pictured in Figure 2, students were able to manipulate currency using the [[augmented reality]] experience provided by the tabletop system. To aid in collaboration the tabletop system allows for multi touch interaction. The interaction is supported by TUOI [^3] an API for tangible multitouch surfaces. The [[Learning Math Using Gesture|Gesture Base]] learning style allows students to use gestures to maneuver the currency and allowances with multi touch.

The tabletop system is another version to [[physical application learning]]. It relies on augmenting the learning routine to teach mathematics tangibly. The ease of use and manipulation, as suggested by the study, contributed to mathematical learning especially for students with supplemental educational needs.
