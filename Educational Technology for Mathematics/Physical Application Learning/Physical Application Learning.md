## Learning Math with Touch and Movement

Physical Learning is the notion that a student learns through movement and touch [^1].  In mathematics, touch is used fairly commonly to help augment the [[learning]] routine. Examples of physical learning in mathematics include the [[Ancient Analog Calculator|Abacus]], counting blocks (Figure 1), counting fingers, and more. Furthermore, learners with visual disabilities utilize [[Audio and Braille]] to learn mathematics, which is a form of augmenting written language to adapt to touch. With advancing technology, systems that augment physical learning in math are being researched and developed for a more math-forward future. These technologies make it easier for students to either model mathematical concepts, or help decipher the conceptual language for them.
