## Using the MR system CETA to Encourage Mathematics Learning

CETA is a [[Mixed Reality]] (MR) system designed for an educational environment such as a school or a daycare [^1]. The system is composed of an android tablet, a mirror, and set of tangible wooden blocks that the learners can manipulate to complete tasks [^1]. The system uses the tablet to display exercises while the mirror reflects the image of the blocks back at the tablet to act as an input for activity interaction [^1]. The entire CETA system is displayed in Figure 1.  In order to complete an activity, [[Elementary School]] students manipulate the blocks according to the exercise instructions [^1]. Like many learning-based systems, CETA involves gamifying algebra ([[Game-Based Learning]]) to increase engagement with the topic as shown in Figure 2. Similarly to the system created by Salman et al., [[Mixed Reality with Tangibles]], engagement is further increased with a fantasy narrator; however, this time it’s a robot named Bruno [^1] [^2].
