## Mixed Reality to aid with Primary School Math

For preschool and [[Elementary School]] mathematical education focusses on the core and basic principles. Teaching young learners’ symbolic math, which is the traditional algebraic math with accompanying numbers and symbols, as well as nonsymbolic math, which deals with comparisons and quantities [^1]. This study by Salman et al. creates a [[Mixed Reality]] (MR) system that utilizes 3D projection mapping and tangible objects for nonsymbolic mathematical practice. On a flat surface, a mapped projection of a mathematical activity is displayed to the learner [^1].  Included with this activity is 3D tangible objects that are part of the mapping as seen in Figure 1. The activity includes a narrated storyline that involves a fantasy dinosaur character to increase the learner’s interest, similarly to [[Game-Based Learning]] systems. The study found that the tangible objects increased engagement with the content, and the MR interaction provided an opportunity for stable concentration for the activity [^1]. These aspects of learning, increased engagement, and concentration are implicated in productive mathematical [[learning]] [^2].
