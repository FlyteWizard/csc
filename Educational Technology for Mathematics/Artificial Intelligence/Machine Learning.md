Regarding a question about "Can machine learning or AI help kids with experiencing difficulty in mathematics master the subject?" in [[Quora]].


[[Machine Learning]]  tools can support kids for several learning minor tasks like [^1] :
-   Figuring out how a symbol is called.
-   Figuring out what a symbol means
-   Getting relevant papers / parts of the lecture notes for a given problem
-   Helping to digitalize stuff for easier sharing / content creation
-   Learning things by heart: there are some nice apps like Anki which help kids to learn arbitrary stuff by heart. The learning algorithm could potentially be improved by AI.
