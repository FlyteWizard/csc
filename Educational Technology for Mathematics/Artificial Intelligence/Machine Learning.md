## Machine Learning (ML) in Mathematical Learning

[[Machine Learning]] (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks [^1]. It is seen as a part of [[Artificial Intelligence]].

In a study, authors showed how [[Machine Learning]] (ML) models can be created and analysed to answer a research issue in education. Using the PISA 2012 data set in an Australian setting, they have utilised ML to investigate the correlations between psychological traits, demographics, and mathematical literacy [^3] .

In another study, using various machine learning methods, authors forecast the mathematical performance of students in the contemporary environment [^4] . Therefore we can say that to improve and facilitate math learning [[Machine Learning]] is helping to building model and applications.
