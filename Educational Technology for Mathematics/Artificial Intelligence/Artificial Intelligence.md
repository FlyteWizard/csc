# Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Mathematical Learning

Artificial intelligence (AI) and [[Machine Learning]] (ML) are titles that describe programs which have been developed to produce "intelligent" output.  In education, AI is used to augment learning in the form of an automated teacher, robotics, and AI assistants [^1].  An automated teacher works much like a real teacher, only they are a program; this program dynamically alters a lesson plan and suggests new exercises based on a learners progress [^1].  For robotics, AI is a useful tool in teaching students math through various building and visualization activities like EV3 Mindstorms by LEGO Robotics[^1, 2].  Finally, AI assistants are like teaching assistants.  AI assistants work with a teaching team to provide support to students [^1].  Machine Learning functions in similar ways to AI while computer vision dynamically assists students by recognizing patterns visually.

A research team conducted a bibliometric mapping analysis and systematic review to explore the role and research trends of AI in mathematics education by searching for the relevant articles published in the quality journals indexed by the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) from the Web of Science (WOS) database [^3].

ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966. at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum. Created to demonstrate the superficiality of communication between humans and machines, Eliza simulated conversation by using a "pattern matching" and substitution methodology [^4].

In another study researchers believe that artificial intelligence can enhance the teaching process like other technological media: from computer algebra systems, online discussions or multimedia it is not going to replace the educators [^5].
