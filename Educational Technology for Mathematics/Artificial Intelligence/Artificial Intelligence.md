## Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Mathematical Learning

Artificial intelligence (AI) and [[Machine Learning]] (ML) are titles that describe programs which have been developed to produce "intelligent" output.  In education, AI is used to augment learning in the form of an automated teacher, robotics, and AI assistants [^1].  An automated teacher works much like a real teacher, only they are a program; this program dynamically alters a lesson plan and suggests new exercises based on a learners progress [^1].  For robotics, AI is a useful tool in teaching students math through various building and visualization activities like EV3 Mindstorms by LEGO Robotics [^1] [^2].  Finally, AI assistants are like teaching assistants.  AI assistants work with a teaching team to provide support to students [^1].  Machine Learning functions in similar ways to AI while computer vision dynamically assists students by recognizing patterns visually.

According to Hwang & Tu, using artificial intelligence within mathematical education is becoming an increasingly notable trend [^3].  Special attention in research has been paid to personalized and adaptive learning with AI [^3].  In another project, Knill described how artificial intelligence can provide support to education in many varieties such as dynamic discussion systems and automated algebra systems, like the Sofia Math Bot [^4].  They also discuss how these systems will not displace teaching staff but aid them [^4].
