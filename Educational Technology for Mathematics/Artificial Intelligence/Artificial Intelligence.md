# Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Mathematical Learning

Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are titles that describe programs which have been developed to produce "intelligent" output.  In education, AI is used to augment learning in the form of an automated teacher, robotics, and AI assistants [^1].  An automated teacher works much like a real teacher, only they are a program; this program dynamically alters a lesson plan and suggests new exercises based on a learners progress [^1].  For robotics, AI is a useful tool in teaching students math through various building and visualization activities like EV3 Mindstorms by LEGO Robotics[^1, 2].  Finally, AI assistants are like teaching assistants.  AI assistants work with a teaching team to provide support to students [^1].  Machine Learning functions in similar ways to AI while computer vision dynamically assists students by recognizing patterns visually.

A research team conducted a bibliometric mapping analysis and systematic review to explore the role and research trends of AI in mathematics education by searching for the relevant articles published in the quality journals indexed by the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) from the Web of Science (WOS) database [^3].
