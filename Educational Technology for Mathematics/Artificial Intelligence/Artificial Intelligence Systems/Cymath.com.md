## Web-Based Math Learning: Cymath.com 

Using [[Artificial Intelligence]], Cymath is an equation-solving system that assists students and learners in their mathematical endeavours by given them step-by-step instruction on how to complete given equations.  Cymath.com is both a [[Web Based Learning]] platform and a [[Mobile-Based Learning]] platform [^1].  This makes it accessible both within and outside of an educational setting.  In Figure 1, an image of the manual equation input screen is shown.  Students will provide their equation as an input, and a detailed guide on how to correctly solve the equation is provided as an output in response [^2].
