[[Microsoft Math]] is an [[Artificial Intelligence]] based math learning and solving system by Microsoft. They built a math solver backend using the math solver engine which is also integrated in OneNote. This is a compute-intensive service which is hosted on Azure cloud and geo-distributed across data centres to provide a performant math experience on the client.

In addition to the solver, they developed and trained a math language to understand the problem type and trigger appropriate answer modules. Using Bing Search APIs, which is available as part of Azure Cognitive Services, it can analyze the math problem, and provide relevant math concepts and video answers [^1].
