## Using Microsoft Math to Assist Learning

Microsoft Math is an [[Artificial Intelligence]] based math [[Learning]] and solving system by Microsoft. Using the math solver engine that is already included into OneNote, Microsoft created a backend for a math solver. For a smooth arithmetic experience for the client, this compute-intensive service is geo-distributed among data centres and hosted on Azure cloud.

In addition to the solver, Microsoft developed and trained a math language to understand the problem type and trigger appropriate answer modules. Using Bing Search APIs, which is available as part of Azure Cognitive Services, it can analyse the given math problem and provide relevant math concepts and video answers [^1].  

This is the next generation invention of Microsoft in aiding [[Learning]] based on [[Educational Technology]]. It's helping thousands of students to interact with the real life math problems, it's also hoping their brainstorming and access to any solution of complex equation.

Figure 1 shows how a learner would utilize their camera to provide an equation to the math-solving system.
