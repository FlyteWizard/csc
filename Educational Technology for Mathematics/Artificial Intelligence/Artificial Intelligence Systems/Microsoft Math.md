## Using Microsoft Math to Assist Learning

Microsoft Math is an [[Artificial Intelligence]] based math [[Learning]] and solving system by Microsoft. Using the math solver engine that is already included in OneNote, Microsoft created a backend environment to aid that existing math solver. For a smooth arithmetic experience for the client, this compute-intensive service is geo-distributed among data centres and hosted on Azure cloud.

The way that Microsoft Math augments mathematical learning is that it analyzes a given math equation that is provided by the learner.  In response to this equation, and while using a specially developed math language, Microsoft Math returns relevant resources and videos to aid in answering the problem [^1].  Figure 1 shows how a learner would utilize their camera to provide an equation to the math-solving system.

This is the next generation invention of Microsoft in aiding [[Learning]] based on [[Educational Technology]]. Its goal is to help thousands of students interact with the real life math problems and create a network of mathematical resources.
