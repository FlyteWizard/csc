# Educational technology


Educational technology (commonly abbreviated as EduTech, or EdTech) is the combined use of computer hardware, software, and educational theory and practice to facilitate [[Learning]] [^1,2]

In addition to practical educational experience, educational technology is based on theoretical knowledge from various disciplines such as communication, education, psychology, sociology, artificial intelligence, and computer science [^3]. It encompasses several domains including [[Learning theory]], computer-based training, online learning, and m-learning where mobile technologies are used.
