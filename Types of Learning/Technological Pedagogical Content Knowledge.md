## Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK)

![[TPACK Diagram.png]]
Figure 1: A diagram depicting the overlap in teaching that is referenced as TPACK [^1].

The diagram in Figure 1 represents the 3 main constructs that embody TPACK. The first component is Pedagogical Knowledge (PK). The second component is Content Knowledge (CK). The third component is Technological Knowledge (TK). Each of these 3 constructs overlap creating Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK), Technological Content Knowledge (TCK), and Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK).

TPACK is the base for effectively teaching with technology [^2]. In other words a teacher’s ability to integrate technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge for effective instruction to support student learning [^1]. 

Thus, learning mathematics with systems and technology also depends on the adoption from educators. The systems and technologies need to aid educators in creating meaningful curriculum for students. And they must be accepted as effective and beneficial to learning.
