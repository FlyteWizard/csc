## Learning Math for High School Students

The high school curriculum focuses on forming a fundamental basis of math concepts more advanced than basic arithmetic. This basis is used in the future for mathematics in [[university]]. Concepts in high school range from 3D geometry, discrete linear relationships, and ratios to the basics of calculus [^1] [^2]. Like most educational environments, students engage in the content by having an educator teach them a lesson, then they complete activities from a textbook to ingrain the mathematical concepts in their head. High school students can benefit from computational augmentation to make it easier for overworked teaching staff to provide quality education to each individual student. Further benefits are to provide efficient [[learning]] strategies for future mathematicians or the student's future career.
