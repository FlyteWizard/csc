# Learning Math for Students in University

University students, relative to the previous math they've learned in high school, learn very complicated mathematical concepts.  Depending on their program's focus, students must learn various levels of calculus.  Calculus is composed of derivatives, integrals, series, and more.  Other disciplines focus on statistical analysis for future research purposes.  The diverse and complex nature of university learning creates an opportunity for many systems to aid in this learning process.  Additionally, universities are the home of many research labs that work on researching to make education and learning more effective for future students of various ages.  The educational setting for university maths is similar to [[High School]] learning in that students are given a lesson and exercises as homework.  However, university is far more self-directed than high school.
