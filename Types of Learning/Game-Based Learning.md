## Game-Based Mathematical Learning

Game-based learning has been popular in an educational setting for a long time with non-digital games being common.  With the introduction of new technology, game-based learning has been revitalized for a new generation.  The psychology behind using games to encourage learning is to increase both engagement and motivation [^1].  Motivation can be increased by manipulating a person’s intrinsic motivations; when a person is interested or enjoys a topic, they will be more productive in learning about it because they are more engaged in the topic [^1] [^2].  By making mathematical learning more interesting by gamifying it, students and learners engage more with the activity and in response, learn more as well.  In Summary, game-based learning is a good way to augment mathematical learning because it increases motivation and engagement, and this is linked to an increase in learning productivity in math [^3].  There is also an opportunity for students to collaborate in a game-based environment as well as flex their competitive muscles in a safe and contained educational setting [^4].
