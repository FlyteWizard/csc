## Learning Math for Kids in Elementary School

Mathematical learning in elementary school focuses on creating a foundation of various concepts. These concepts start with simple arithmetic and build into more complex arithmetic [^1]. Typically elementary school mathematics end with students being able to calculate complicated arithmetic including fractions and linear relations [^2]. In a typical educational environment, students are encouraged to learn mathematical concepts by practicing exercises from a textbook. These textbooks include written language, written explanations, and visual diagrams to aid students in their learning. However, with the advancement in new technology, learning augmentation for elementary school environments can be more accessible and further progress mathematical learning for this age group. Further, in order to keep younger students engaged, educators will often use [[Game-Based Learning]] to increase motivation in the content.
